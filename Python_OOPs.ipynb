        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and functions (methods). It focuses on organizing code for reusability, modularity, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "It defines the attributes and methods that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It represents a real-world entity with state (data) and behavior (methods).\n",

        "\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore) methods are special built-in methods that start and end with __.\n",
        "Examples: __init__, __str__, __len__.\n",
        "Used to implement operator overloading and object behavior customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire attributes + methods of another class (parent).\n",
        "It promotes code reuse and hierarchical structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism means same function name, different behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance means that a child class can override methods of a parent class, and Python will decide which method to call at runtime based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",

        "Polymorphism works because each subclass provides its own implementation of the parent method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, where each method returns the object (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Number:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, value):\n",

        "        self.value += n\n",
        "        return self    # enables chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "    def multiply(self, n):\n",

        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
